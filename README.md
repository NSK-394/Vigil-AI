# VigilAI — Autonomous Security Agent System

> **Real-Time API Threat Intelligence powered by an Agentic AI Loop**

VigilAI is an end-to-end autonomous security system that detects, reasons about, and responds to API abuse — without human intervention. Four specialized AI agents collaborate in a continuous loop, backed by persistent memory, to classify threats, generate auditable reasoning traces, and take prioritized response actions in real time.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Agentic Architecture** — Four agents (Monitor → Detection → Decision → Response) run a continuous Observe → Reason → Decide → Act loop, not a one-shot pipeline
- **Dual-Engine Fusion** — IsolationForest (ML) and a rule-based scoring engine run in parallel; each vote is weighted by its own confidence before fusion
- **Persistent Memory** — Short-term sliding window detects burst velocity; long-term EMA baseline per key survives restarts and learns repeat offenders over time
- **Explainable Decisions** — Every verdict ships a structured reasoning trace explaining exactly which signals fired, why, and with what confidence — no black-box outputs
- **Adaptive Response** — The feedback loop updates behavioral baselines after every action; keys accumulating 3+ HIGH verdicts auto-escalate on future cycles
- **Production Parallels** — Architecture directly mirrors SIEM (IBM QRadar), SOAR (Splunk SOAR), and WAF (AWS WAF) systems used in enterprise SOC workflows

## What Makes This Agentic

Most detection systems are stateless pipelines: data goes in, a score comes out. VigilAI's agents are different:

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Memory** | Short-term sliding window tracks burst velocity; long-term memory builds a per-key behavioral baseline that survives restarts |
| **Confidence scoring** | Every engine vote is weighted by how certain it is — a score of 50 carries zero weight |
| **Reasoning traces** | Every decision produces a human-readable explanation: which signals fired, why, with what confidence |
| **Feedback loop** | After each action, the agent updates long-term memory — the system learns repeat offenders over time |
| **Action prioritization** | BLOCK > RATE_LIMIT > ALERT > LOG — context-sensitive, not a fixed threshold |

### Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Phase | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **MonitorAgent** | Observe | Generates logs, extracts features, injects 5 memory-derived fields: velocity, baseline deviation, repeat-offender flag, historical avg, prior observations |
| **DetectionAgent** | Reason | Runs rule engine + IsolationForest in parallel; produces `rule_confidence` and `ml_confidence` per key — not just raw scores |
| **DecisionAgent** | Decide | Confidence-weighted fusion of both engines; selects action via priority ladder; generates full reasoning trace + short summary per verdict |
| **ResponseAgent** | Act | Executes BLOCK / RATE_LIMIT / ALERT / LOG; builds structured alert dicts with reasoning; closes the feedback loop into long-term memory |

---

## Detection Pipeline

1. **Feature Extraction** — Logs grouped by `api_key`. Features: `total_requests`, `average_requests`, `unique_endpoints`, `request_variance` — enriched with memory signals.

2. **Rule Engine** — Heuristic scoring (0–100): high average requests (+40), low endpoint diversity (+30), near-zero variance (+25), extreme behavior bonus (+20).

3. **ML Engine** — IsolationForest scores each key's feature vector for statistical outlier-ness. Scores normalized to 0–100.

4. **Confidence Weighting** — Scores near 50 (ambiguous zone) carry near-zero weight; scores near 0 or 100 carry full weight. Each engine votes proportionally to its certainty.

5. **Fusion** — Confidence-weighted average of both engines. Memory boosts applied: +18 for repeat offenders, +12 for velocity spikes, +10 for >60% baseline deviation.

6. **Decision** — Fused score ≥65 → HIGH, ≥35 → MEDIUM, <35 → LOW. HIGH always BLOCKs. Repeat offenders escalate from MEDIUM to BLOCK automatically.

7. **Feedback** — Every outcome is written into long-term memory (EMA baseline update, HIGH-count increment). The system learns across sessions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & setup
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-redteam.git
cd ai-redteam
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Launch dashboard
python -m streamlit run src/dashboard.py

# 3. Or run the CLI agent (no dashboard needed)
python run_agent.py                        # normal traffic, infinite loop
python run_agent.py --mode attack          # attack simulation
python run_agent.py --mode suspicious --cycles 10 --interval 2
```

> Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8501`

---

## Production Integration

### FastAPI (Python)

Add VigilAI monitoring to any existing FastAPI app in 3 lines:

```python
from src.middleware.fastapi_middleware import VigilMiddleware
app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(VigilMiddleware, vigil_url="http://localhost:9000/ingest")
```

Then start the ingest server in a separate terminal:

```bash
uvicorn src.middleware.ingest_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

### Express (Node.js)

```javascript
const { createVigilMiddleware } = require('./src/middleware/express_middleware');
const app = express();
app.use(createVigilMiddleware({ vigilUrl: 'http://localhost:9000/ingest' }));
```

The Express middleware uses only Node.js built-in modules — no npm installs needed.

### Alert Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values
2. **Slack** — create an incoming webhook at https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks and paste the URL as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. **Email** — enable 2FA on your Gmail account, generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords, then set `GMAIL_ADDRESS` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

Alerts fire automatically whenever a key is BLOCKed (HIGH verdict or repeat-offender escalation) — no code changes required. Both channels run in background threads and never slow down the detection pipeline.

## Demo Scenarios

Click the buttons in the top bar to switch scenarios instantly:

### 🟢 Normal Traffic
- 85% normal user traffic — low risk scores, green KPIs
- Sample reasoning: `[LOW | conf=78% | fused=11.0] — no significant signals — baseline behavior.`

### 🟡 Suspicious Activity
- 45% attack traffic — MEDIUM scores, amber warnings
- Sample reasoning: `[MEDIUM | conf=30% | fused=48.0] — rule engine: moderately elevated activity (score 55).`

### 🔴 Attack Mode
- 80% attack traffic — HIGH scores spike, keys auto-blocked
- Sample reasoning: `[HIGH | conf=95% | fused=97.6] — rule engine: high-volume/low-diversity (score 95); ML: statistical outlier (anomaly 91.2); short-term memory: velocity spike +70; long-term memory: >=3 prior HIGH verdicts (repeat offender).`

## Real-World Parallels

This architecture mirrors production security systems:

| VigilAI Component | Production Equivalent |
|---|---|
| MonitorAgent | Log ingestion layer (Splunk forwarder, Kafka consumer) |
| DetectionAgent | SIEM correlation engine (IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel) |
| DecisionAgent | SOAR playbook engine (Palo Alto XSOAR, Splunk SOAR) |
| ResponseAgent | WAF enforcement layer (AWS WAF, Cloudflare) |
| LongTermMemory | Threat intelligence database (MISP, ThreatConnect) |
| Reasoning traces | SOC analyst audit trail |

## 🔮 Future Work

VigilAI's modular agent architecture makes the following extensions straightforward:

- **Real API Ingestion** — Replace the simulator with a FastAPI middleware layer that streams live request logs into `MonitorAgent`, enabling deployment against real traffic without changing any downstream agent
- **External Threat Intel** — Integrate feeds from MISP or AbuseIPDB into `LongTermMemory` so the agent can cross-reference IPs and API keys against known threat actor databases
- **LLM-Powered Triage** — Route HIGH-confidence alerts to a Claude/GPT chain that generates a full incident report and suggests remediation steps — closing the loop from detection to operator brief
- **Distributed Multi-Agent Scaling** — Shard `MonitorAgent` across multiple workers (one per API gateway region), with a central `DecisionAgent` aggregating signals — matching how large SIEMs handle multi-region ingestion
- **Adversarial Robustness** — Add evasion-detection logic to flag keys that deliberately keep scores near the 50-point ambiguity boundary (slow-drip attacks designed to stay MEDIUM indefinitely)
